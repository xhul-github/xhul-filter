HASINFLUENCE & == OPERATOR

The parser interprets == as if it was = (implicit operator).
For example, HasInfluence == Crusader Elder will match items with crusader OR elder influence, whereas ingame, it will only match items with BOTH influences.

SWITCHTO & BLOCK SWITCHES

When a block changes with a SwitchTo command, its status isn't updated on the "Block switches" tab.

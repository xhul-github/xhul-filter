TEXTAREA FIELDS

When left empty in the UI, reparsing will reload the default content.

HASINFLUENCE & == OPERATOR

The parser interprets == as if it was = (implicit operator).
For example, HasInfluence == Crusader Elder will match items with crusader OR elder influence, whereas ingame, it will only match items with BOTH influences.

BLOCK SWITCHES TAB

Category|block labels including only digits are incorrectly displayed (incremented value).

When a category checkbox changes upon altering that category's content (subcategories, sub-blocks), it will always be a "partial" status.
Additionally, once that happens, the checkbox cannot be modified indirectly (parent categories, subcategories, sub-blocks) anymore.
Those 2 behaviours appear to be visual issues only.

The expand|collapse indicator doesn't change according to the actual category status (expanded|collapsed) as it should.
Instead, it simply changes when clicked on.

SWITCHTO & BLOCK SWITCHES

When a block changes with a SwitchTo command, its status isn't updated on the "Block switches" tab.

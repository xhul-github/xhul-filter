QUEST ITEMS - BUG

A block that doesn't include a Class condition with a "Quest Items" argument will never match a quest item.
For example, a block with just a BaseType "Medicine Chest" condition will never match the corresponding item at all.
That behaviour actually implies the existence of a separate parser, dedicated to quest items.

UNPARSEABLE PROPHECIES - BUG

Among the legacy prophecies, some (not all of them) can't be referred to at all (filter loading failure).
You have to use some tricks to actually filter them, here is the full list:

"A Gracious Master"
"Ancient Rivalries I"
"Brothers in Arms"
"Echoes of Lost Love"
"Echoes of Mutation"
"The Aesthete's Spirit"
"The Blacksmith"
"The Emperor's Trove"

EXACT EQUAL WITH CLASS CONDITIONS - BUG

The == operator works fine with BaseType, HasExplicitMod, and Prophecy conditions.
However, it behaves the same as = (implicit operator) when used with Class conditions.

CORRUPTEDMODS OPERATORS - UNDOCUMENTED

Conditional operators can be used with CorruptedMods conditions.
They all work as expected except = & ==, which both behave the same as the implicit operator (exact match).

NON-ITEM CLASSES - MISC

Those don't include any regular item in the game:

"Delve Socketable Currency" - leftover empty class
"Hideout Doodads"
"Labyrinth Map Item" - leftover empty class
"Large Relics" - unknown purpose
"Medium Relics" - unknown purpose
Microtransactions
"Shard Heart" - unknown purpose
"Small Relics" - unknown purpose

UNKNOWN BASE - UNDOCUMENTED

There is a base called "...", that is properly parsed by the game.
It's actually its full name (BaseType == ... isn't rejected upon filter loading).
No idea to which class it belongs.
I'm actually using that base in filterblast, to have some blocks never match any item.

SETFONTSIZE BEHAVIOUR - UNDOCUMENTED

If you want to use some actually accurate SetFontSize arguments, i tested everything from 10 to 50.
Despite a Reddit post i made a while ago about it, it seems that most people prefer to believe the wiki, at least i tried.
The following numbers are accurate when playing in 1920x1080 resolution or below, i don't own a monitor supporting more than that.
So, basically:
17 is the smallest visual you can get.
45 is the biggest visual you can get.
The default size (no SetFontSize condition in the block), is either 33, or 34.
I kept the screenshots of those if needed.
Full list:

SetFontSize	dimensions (pixels)

17 & below	36x19
18 & 19		37x20
20		40x21
21 & 22		41x22
23		45x23
24 & 25		46x24
26		50x25
27 & 28		52x26
29		54x27
30 & 31		57x28
32		59x29
33,34,default	62x30
35		64x31
36 & 37		66x32
38		69x33
39		71x34
40 & 41		74x35
42		77x36
43 & 44		78x37
45 & above	82x38
